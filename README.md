# OOD_Attack_NN

This repo contains the code for our paper titled "an algorithm for out of distribution attack to neural network encoder"

https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08016

Python: 3.7
Pytorch: 1.5

Currently, using the OOD Attack, we tested 13 OOD detection methods (Classficaition-based and Glow-based) reported at ICLR, NeurIPS, etc, and the AUROC scores of these methods are close to 0.5.

The code, data and result are in a zip file shared via Google Drive.
You can download it (~20GB) from

In another work, we show that reconstruction-autoencoder based OOD detection was ineffective for a medical image analysis application.

Conclusion:
AI doctor on a human-expert level still remains to be a distant dream. 
Current neural network-based medical systems should serve only as assistants to human doctors.

# OOD_Attack_NN

This repo contains the code for our paper titled "an algorithm for out of distribution attack to neural network encoder"

https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08016

The code was a small part of my private repo for neural network robustness research.

Python: 3.7

Pytorch: 1.5

The parameters of the attacks are in the paper

Currently, using our algorithm, we tested five OOD detection methods (many of which were published in ICLR), and the AUROC scores of these methods are close to 0.5.
